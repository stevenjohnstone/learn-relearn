# Learn and Relearn

I'm taking [advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/) to take a second look at topics I've learned (now half a liftime ago). In this repo, I'll keep notes, reviews, alternate proofs and solutions to exercises.


## [A First Course in Stochastic Calculus](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=AMSTEXT/53)

In [/FCSC](/FCSC), there's a [qaurto](https://quarto.org) notebook of solutions to the exercises.

## [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)

See [/PML](/PML) for solution exercises and experiments.
